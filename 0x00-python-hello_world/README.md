        How to use the Python interpreter
        ---------------------------------
1).Accessing the Interpreter:
Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
Type python or python3 (depending on your system configuration) and press Enter.
 You should see the Python interpreter's prompt, usually >>>.
Example:
$ python
Python 3.9.5 (default, May  3 2021, 08:50:45)
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

2).Running Python Code:
You can now start typing Python code directly after the >>> prompt and press Enter to execute each line of code.
For example, you can do simple calculations:
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!

3).Exiting the Interpreter:

To exit the Python interpreter, you can use the exit() function, 
Ctrl+Z followed by Enter on Windows, or Ctrl+D on macOS and Linux. 
 This will return you to the regular command prompt or terminal.
Example:
>>> exit()
$

4).Multi-Line Statements:
For multi-line statements, you can use backslashes \ to indicate that the statement continues on
 the next line, or you can use parentheses to group the lines.
Example with backslashes:
>>> a = 5 + \
...     3
>>> a
8

5).Running Scripts:
# script.py
print("Hello from a Python script!")

Save It And Execute
$ python script.py
Hello from a Python script!
