    Why python programming is awesome?
.Readability and Simplicity .Versatility .Community and Ecosystem .Cross platform Compatibility .Large Standard library

    Who created python?
..Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer. He began working on Python in the late 1980s and released the first version, Python 0.9.0, in February 1991.

    Where does the name python come from?
..The name "Python" for the programming language has an interesting origin. It is not named after the snake but is a reference to the British comedy group Monty Python.

    How to use the Python interpreter
    ---------------------------------
1).Accessing the Interpreter: Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer. Type python or python3 (depending on your system configuration) and press Enter. You should see the Python interpreter's prompt, usually >>>. Example: $ python Python 3.9.5 (default, May 3 2021, 08:50:45) [GCC 8.4.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

2).Running Python Code: You can now start typing Python code directly after the >>> prompt and press Enter to execute each line of code. For example, you can do simple calculations:

2 + 2 4 print("Hello, Python!") Hello, Python!

3).Exiting the Interpreter:

To exit the Python interpreter, you can use the exit() function, Ctrl+Z followed by Enter on Windows, or Ctrl+D on macOS and Linux. This will return you to the regular command prompt or terminal. Example:

exit() $

4).Multi-Line Statements: For multi-line statements, you can use backslashes \ to indicate that the statement continues on the next line, or you can use parentheses to group the lines. Example with backslashes:

a = 5 +
... 3 a 8

5).Running Scripts:

script.py
print("Hello from a Python script!")

Save It And Execute $ python script.py Hello from a Python script!
